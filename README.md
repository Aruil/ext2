# Simulated ext2

The purpose of the project was to simulate a (linux) filesystem, with functional commands that copy data in and out of a master file that plays the role of a whole disk. The implemantation was left to my discretion and in order to learn more I chose to take inspiration from the ext2 filesystem. The end result uses some of the prominent features of the original, but it is not as complete.
